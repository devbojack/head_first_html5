## What is UTF-8?
Unicode Transformation Format-8.<br>
It's a character encoding standard that's widely used in computing to represent text in various languages and scripts.

**Unicode:** A standard that assigns a unique number (code point) to every character in almost every language and script used today. It aims to encompass characters from all writing systems worldwide.

**Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8):** A method for encoding these Unicode characters into a sequence of bytes for storage or transmission in computer systems. It's a variable-length encoding, meaning different characters can take different numbers of bytes to represent.

UTF-8 is popular because it's backward compatible with ASCII. It's also efficient in representing characters from various languages while being flexible and space-efficient. This makes it widely used for encoding text on the internet, in operating systems, programming languages, and many other applications.
