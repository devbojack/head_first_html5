# Getting to Know HTML5: Welcome to Webville

<br>

- **HTML5** is the newest version of HTML. It introduces simplified tags, new semantic and media elements, and relies on a set of JavaScript libraries that enable web applications.
- XHTML is no longer the standard for web pages. Developers and the W3C decided to keep extending and improving HTML instead.
- The new, simpler HTML5 doctype is supported by older browsers—they use standards mode when they see this doctype.
- The **type** attribute is no longer needed in the &lt;script&gt; tag or in a stylesheet link to CSS. **JavaScript** and **CSS** are now the defaults.
- The &lt;meta&gt; tag used for specifying the character set has been simplified to include only the character encoding.
- **UTF-8** is now the standard charset in use on the Web.
- Making changes to the doctype and &lt;meta&gt; tag won’t break your pages in older browsers.
- HTML5’s new elements are a superset of HTML 4 elements, which means older pages will continue to work in modern browsers.
- HTML5 introduces elements that add new semantics to your pages, giving you more options for creating web page structure than we had with HTML 4.01. 
- Many of the new features in HTML5 require JavaScript to make the most of them.
- Using JavaScript, you can interact with the DOM—the Document Object Model.
- The DOM is the browser’s internal representation of a web page. Using JavaScript, you can access elements, change elements, and add new elements to the DOM.
- A **JavaScript API** is an ***“Application Programming Interface.”*** APIs make it possible to control all aspects of HTML5, like 2D drawing, video playback, and more.
- **CSS** is the style standard for HTML5; many people include CSS when they use the term “HTML5” to describe the family of technologies used to create web applications.

## What is UTF-8?
***Unicode Transformation Format-8.***<br>
It's a character encoding standard that's widely used in computing to represent text in various languages and scripts.

**Unicode:** A standard that assigns a unique number (code point) to every character in almost every language and script used today. It aims to encompass characters from all writing systems worldwide.

**Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8):** A method for encoding these Unicode characters into a sequence of bytes for storage or transmission in computer systems. It's a variable-length encoding, meaning different characters can take different numbers of bytes to represent.

UTF-8 is popular because it's backward compatible with ASCII. It's also efficient in representing characters from various languages while being flexible and space-efficient. This makes it widely used for encoding text on the internet, in operating systems, programming languages, and many other applications.
